## 1. Background and Overview

This personal project provides a deep analytical visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across Indonesia from early 2020 to late 2022. The dashboard offers both national and provincial-level insights by tracking key health metrics such as new cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and population density. It highlights trends over time, geographic distributions, and health system responses.

The purpose of this project is to:

* Track pandemic trends over time
* Identify high-risk regions
* Monitor health recovery and fatality performance
